## 3. Core Process

**Main Trading Flow:**
User accesses trading interface → Selects currency pair → Analyzes chart with technical indicators → Sets order parameters (type, size, SL/TP) → Executes trade → Monitors position in real-time → Closes or modifies position as needed.

**Risk Management Flow:**
User configures risk parameters → System calculates position size based on account balance → Validates order against risk limits → Displays warnings for high-risk trades → Requires confirmation for large positions → Monitors exposure in real-time.

**Mobile Trading Flow:**
User accesses mobile interface → Views stacked layout with chart on top → Swipes between chart and trading panel → Uses simplified order entry → Manages positions through card-based interface.
