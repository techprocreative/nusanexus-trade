## 3. Core Process

**User Settings Management Flow:**
Users access settings through the main navigation, navigate between different setting categories using a tabbed interface, make changes with real-time validation, and save changes with confirmation feedback. Critical changes like password updates or account deletion require additional verification steps.

**MT5 Connection Setup Flow:**
Users add new broker connections by selecting from a dropdown or entering custom server details, input credentials which are encrypted before storage, test the connection for validation, and manage multiple accounts with easy switching capabilities.

**Security Configuration Flow:**
Users enable two-factor authentication through QR code scanning, set up security questions for account recovery, generate and securely store backup codes, and monitor their account security through login history and active session management.
