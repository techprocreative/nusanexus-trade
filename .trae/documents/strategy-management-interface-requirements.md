When they need detailed analysis, they open the Strategy Details Modal to view comprehensive analytics, configure parameters, and analyze backtest results. For managing multiple strategies, they use the Bulk Operations Panel to perform batch actions and compare performance. The AI Insights Dashboard provides ongoing recommendations for strategy optimization and market compatibility.
